# Why AI Agent Tools Fail in Production (And How to Fix It)

## The Demo Worked. Production Didn't.

Your agent demo was flawless. It searched the web, scraped a competitor's pricing page, parsed a PDF contract, and wrote a summary. Everyone applauded.

Three weeks into production, it's hallucinating prices because the scraper hits a CAPTCHA. The browser session drops after 47 pages. The PDF parser chokes on a scanned document. Your agent doesn't know any of this is happening — it just keeps going with garbage data.

This isn't a model problem. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini — they all work fine. The problem is **everything they call**.

## The Three Tool Failure Modes

### 1. The Silent Failure
The tool returns a 200 OK with an empty body. Or a Cloudflare challenge page as HTML. Your agent treats it as real data. Downstream everything looks fine — until a human notices the output is nonsense.

### 2. The Cascade
A rate limit triggers a retry. The retry hits another rate limit. The agent decides to try a different approach — maybe scraping a cached version. The cached version is from 2023. Now your agent is making decisions based on two-year-old data, with full confidence.

### 3. The Drift
The tool worked yesterday. Today the target site changed its DOM structure. Or updated their anti-bot detection. Or rotated their API keys. Your agent has no idea. It calls the same endpoint and gets something completely different back.

## Why This Keeps Happening

Every AI team rebuilds the same infrastructure:
- Proxy rotation that actually works
- Browser automation that survives anti-bot detection
- Rate limiting that doesn't cascade
- Error handling that distinguishes "tool failed" from "bad result"
- Session management across hundreds of concurrent requests

This is reliability engineering, not AI engineering. But every team treats it as an afterthought.

## The Fix: Treat Tools as Infrastructure

The solution isn't better prompting or smarter agents. It's treating the tool layer as production infrastructure — with the same care you'd give a database or a message queue.

That means:
- **Managed browser sessions** with automatic proxy rotation and anti-bot bypass
- **Structured error responses** that tell the agent "this tool failed" vs "this data might be stale"
- **Request-level observability** — know which calls failed, why, and how long they took
- **Automatic retries** with intelligent backoff (not just exponential — actually rotating the approach)
- **Sandboxed execution** so one bad input can't take down the system

## What We Built

AgentForge provides five reliable tools via clean REST APIs:

```bash
# Search the web
curl -X POST https://agentforge.dev/v1/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer at_your_key" \
  -d '{"query": "UK minimum wage 2026", "num_results": 5}'

# Scrape structured data
curl -X POST https://agentforge.dev/v1/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer at_your_key" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com/pricing", "schema": {"price": "number", "plan": "string"}}'
```

One API key. Credit-based pricing. We absorb the reliability engineering.

Your agent calls a clean endpoint. We handle the proxy rotation, the anti-bot bypass, the session management, the sandboxing.
